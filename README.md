**Algernon** is a front-end e-commerce boilerplate based on Angular, Angular CLI, Angular Router, Angular Material, rxjs, Angular Flex-Layout, and others. Designed to connect to HTTP API endpoints that serve responses in JSON. Mock API reponses are included in this repo which are easily removable and replaced with actual responses.

The purpose of this project is to build an e-commerce front end web app using Google supported technologies. As such we chose Angular Material over Semantic UI, rxjs over Redux, etc. So if there any choices that we might have better made in this direction, please reach out to us or submit a PR. 

- Build a supporting backend to link to Algernon, using Mongo and Express/Feathers.
